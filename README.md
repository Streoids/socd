# What is SOCD?
socd (<ins>Simultaneous Opposing Cardinal Directions</ins>) also known as <ins>Null movement</ins> that helps to nullify the last key pressed in your keyboard<br>
For example:<br>
imagine you hold 'A' and press 'D', they keyboards with no SOCD will neutralize both keys therefore the ingame player doesn't move<br>
if you have SOCD enabled the keyboard will listen to the last key pressed therefore holding 'A' and pressing 'D' force the keyboard to cancels 'A' so that only 'D' works, vise versa<br>
# ⚠️Important
Some games prohibits keyboards with SOCD enabled and can get you banned/kicked.<br>
<b>By using this tool, you acknowledge that you are responsible for its use and i will not be responsible if you get banned or kicked.</b><br>
